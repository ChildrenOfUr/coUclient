 * Exports all the individual parts of the collection-helper library.

 * The sub-libraries of this package are:
 *
 * - `algorithms.dart`: Algorithms that work on lists (shuffle, binary search
 *                      and various sorting algorithms).
 * - `equality.dart`: Different notions of equality of collections.
 * - `iterable_zip.dart`: Combining multiple iterables into one.
 * - `priority_queue.dart`: Priority queue type and implementations.
 * - `wrappers.dart`: Wrapper classes that delegate to a collection object.
 *                    Includes unmodifiable views of collections.
