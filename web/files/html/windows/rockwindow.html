                <p>This game is very much in a "pre-alpha" state.</p>
                <p>That means everything you see, do, or collect may change without warning, and some things <em>will</em> be broken.</p>
                <p>It <em>doesn't</em> mean that your progress or stuff will evaporate like last night's dream. When you come back, it should all still be here.</p>

                <p>That being said, the CoU dev team wants you to know that they care about you loads and hope you'll have fun in this little world.</p>

        <!-- Getting Started -->

        <div class="rockWindowContent convo" id="rwc-start" data-endphrase="6" hidden>
            <div id="rwc-start-1">
                <p>Children of Ur is a game about exploring, imagination, having fun with friends, imagination (did I already say that one?)...</p>
                <p>When you first start out in the world, you have no money, items, or imagination. Your goal is to <del>get as much of these as you can</del> have fun.</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" data-goto="2">Alrighty then...</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-start-2">
                <p>To get more money (shown at the bottom left of your screen), you can collect currant quoins (the brown floaty-spinny things) to get enough to buy a pick, then mine rocks. Or dig dirt. Or harvest something. But whatever you collect, you can sell it to vendors (the floating brown things that follow you creepily) for money.</p>
                <p>You can get imagination points (shown at the top left of your screen) the same way, but with the purple quoins.</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" data-goto="3">Sounds easy enough.</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-start-3">
                <p>But there's a catch! While you're doing this, you need to watch your energy and mood meters. They are the things at the top left, next to your face.</p>
                <p>Having zero energy is a good way to die, though having a low mood won't affect the amount of imagination you get (yet), but it's good to get in the habit of watching them.</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" data-goto="4">I'll watch them, I guess.</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-start-4">
                <p>You <em>guess</em>? Well, I suppose that's good enough for me.</p>
                <p>If your energy ever gets really low and you can't find any energy quoins, just wait until that clock at the top right says 6:00am. I'm generous enough to give everyone a full energy tank each morning.</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" data-goto="5">Uh... thanks in advance.</a></div>
            </div>
            <div id="rwc-start-5">
                <p>No problem. If you ever need anything, I'm here for you.</p>
                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" data-goto="6">Okay, talk to you later.</a></div>

                <p>Good! I was afraid of being too mean. Well, not really... but whatever.</p>
                <p>My point is, you ran out of energy and died. You probably should've eaten more.</p>

                <div class="flex-row rwc-exit"><a class="rwc-button" data-goto="4">And how much time is that?</a></div>
