    <p>This game is very much in a "pre-alpha" state.</p>
    <p>That means everything you see, do, or collect may change without warning, and some things <em>will</em> be broken.</p>
    <p>It <em>doesn't</em> mean that your progress or stuff will evaporate like last night's dream. When you come back, it should all still be here.</p>
    <p>Please report bugs at the project's page on <a href="https://github.com/ChildrenOfUr/coUclient/issues" target="_blank">Github</a>, and send us suggestions by clicking the little <i class="fa fa-bug"></i> icon in the top right.</p>
    <p>We want you to know that we care about you loads and hope you'll have fun in our little world.</p>
