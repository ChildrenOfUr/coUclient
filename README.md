##General Roadmap##
The project is built in Dart, which is then compiled and minified into javascript and can run in most browsers.

main.dart serves as the main game loop. This class controls all functions within the game.

To test the project, it can be run at any time within the Dartium browser, wchih natively supports Dart.
To test the project within other browsers, it is necessary to first compile the project.
In coUclient, run tools > Publish_web.dart to compile your current build of the project.
